README file for Project 1, ECEN5813 Embedded Systems Programming

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this repository is to complete the assigned work for
project 1 for ECEN 5813.  A full description of the assignment is included in this repo.

SUMMARY:  Serveral functions dealing with memory allocation, manipulations, and type conversions were created in several .c and .h files.  These files were used to create and test a makefile.  This makefile was to compile workable code for the host computer, Beaglebone Black Board, and KL25Z Freedom board.  In addition to these requirements, git and GitHub was to be used by both members of the group to track changes made.

GROUP:  The code included was written and maintained by Andrew Kuklinski and Mason Darveaux

DUE DATE:  Deadline for the project 1 submission is October 4th, 2017 by midnight.
